Recently, some orchards have been attacked by wild animals, putting our supply of fruits and vegetables at risk. It saddens me to see our beloved orchards suffering from these attacks. Fruits are an essential part of our diet, and furthermore, our hard work is rewarded with abundant harvests. We need to take action to protect our crops and ensure the continuation of a healthy and plentiful food supply. I appeal to all hobbits to remain vigilant and contribute with solutions. We can strengthen the orchards' fences, utilize animal deterrent techniques, or even create night patrols to ensure security. Together, we can preserve our orchards and maintain balance between the Shire and nature.",

Gardens connect us with nature, bring beauty, and teach us the value of patience and care. As hobbits, we treasure our gardens as an extension of our homes. In them, we cultivate colorful flowers that adorn our houses, aromatic herbs that add flavor to our meals, and fresh vegetables that nourish us. Moreover, gardens are spaces of tranquility and contemplation where we can disconnect from the outside world and find inner peace. I invite you to reflect on the importance of cultivating a piece of land, no matter how small. Let's share gardening tips, discuss the benefits of having plants around us, and inspire each other to take care of the nature that surrounds us. Together, we can make a difference by cultivating beauty and harmony in our lives and in our beloved Shire.",
